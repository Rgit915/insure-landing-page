## My process


### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I Learned
In this project,  I learned how to toggle and style elements dynamically using JavaScript and CSS, particularly managing the active states of menus and links. Additionally, I explored working with inline SVGs and modifying their styles for hover and active states.

## Continued Development
I aim to deepen my knowledge of accessibility considerations in navigation and continue improving my skills in creating interactive, responsive interfaces.

## Useful Resources
- [SVG Styling Guide](https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/) - Provided insights into styling inline SVGs with CSS.
- [JavaScript Event Listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) - For managing menu interactions and dynamic updates.
